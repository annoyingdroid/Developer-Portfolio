            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>
                Began working with computers almost since the day I was born. Started working with them 
                professionally at the age of 14 instead of playing outside like a normal child. 
                Since then I have been honing my abilities as a professional and have completed my B.S. in 
                Computer Science at Clemson University. I run an apparel company with my brother, Cool Guy Apparel 
                and am also an experienced music producer with roughly 10 years of experience. 
                <br><br>
                Experience in a variety of computer science topics, mostly in the realm of software development. 
                6 years of general IT experience under my belt and counting. A self-starter and a fast learner who's 
                always ready to get started on his next project.
